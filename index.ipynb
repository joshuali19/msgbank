For example, the base text font within the `<html>` tag is `sans-serif`, and the background is lilac purple, as opposed to a generic white. Further customization is done to make the website look nice, and I would highly encourage you to look at the [official CSS documentation]() **<--INSERT LINK HERE** for more information."
